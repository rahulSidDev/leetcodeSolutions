# D & C Introduction

A divide and conquer (d&c) algorithm works by recursively breaking the problem into 2 or more subproblems of the same field or related type, until these subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly. Then the results of the subproblems are combined into one final solution.

D & C algos are different from regular recursive algos since the problem is divided into 2 or more sub problems rather than one single problem. The latter kind of recursive algos are also known as decrease and conquer like binary search.

There are generally 3 steps in a d&c algo:

1. Divide - Divide the problem S into smaller problems {S1, S2, S3, ... Sn} where n >= 2.
2. Conquer - Solve each subproblem recursively.
3. Combine - Combine the results of each sub-problems.
